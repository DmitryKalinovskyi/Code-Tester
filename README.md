# Code Tester Platform

Code Tester Platform consists of three main components:
- **Code Tester API**: An ASP.NET Core Web API for executing and testing code remotely.
- **Code Tester Web Client**: A React-based frontend for interacting with the API.
- **Docs**: Dinosaurus ðŸ˜Š docs.

---

## Docker Compose
I've prepared a dev.docker-compose.yml file and a build_dev.sh script to easily build and start the **API**, **Web Client**, and **Docs** services in development.

To get started, simply run the following command:
```sh
sh build_dev.sh
```
This will:

Build the images for the **API**, **Web Client**, and **Docs** services.
Start all three services (API, Web Client, and Docs) using Docker Compose.
