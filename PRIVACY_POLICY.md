Welcome to Code Tester API. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our service.

## 2. Data Collection  
We do not collect or store any personal metadata, such as IP addresses, session data, or tracking information. However, we do temporarily collect the following:

This data is only stored during the execution process and is immediately discarded afterward.

## 3. Use of Cookies  
Our application only uses necessary and functional cookies for:
- Storing user settings (e.g., theme, compiler preferences, written code).

We do not use cookies for analytics, tracking, or marketing purposes.

## 4. Data Security  
- No personal credentials are stored within the application.
- All data transmission is encrypted using HTTPS.
- There is no API-level protection against malicious code execution, so users are responsible for their input.

## 5. GDPR Compliance  
In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
- We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII).
- Users have the right to inquire about data processing, but no stored personal data exists to be modified or deleted.
- Since no personal data is retained, there is no data portability requirement.

## 6. Third-Party Services  
We do not share, sell, or transmit data to any third-party services, including analytics, hosting, or monitoring platforms.
