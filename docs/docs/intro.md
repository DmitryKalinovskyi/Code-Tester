# Code Tester Documentation

Welcome to the **Code Tester Documentation**! This guide provides an in-depth look at the Code Tester platform, including its API and web client, to help you understand how to execute and test code remotely.

## Overview
Code Tester is a platform designed for developers and educators who need a remote code execution environment. It consists of two main components:

- **Code Tester API**: A backend service built with ASP.NET Core Web API that supports executing Python, C++, and Java code remotely.
- **Code Tester Web Client**: A React-based frontend that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API.

## Purpose of the Documentation
This documentation is structured to guide developers through:
- Setting up and using the Code Tester API
- Understanding how the web client interacts with the API
- Exploring the supported programming languages and features
- Contributing to the project

## Getting Started
To begin using Code Tester, choose one of the following sections:
- **[API Documentation](asp-core-api/code-tester)** – Learn how to make API requests, execute code, and handle responses.
- **[Web Client Guide](web-client/code-editor)** – Understand how to use the frontend for seamless code execution.

Happy coding!
